# Converse-Now
**UNDER DEVELOPMENT**
##Overview:
Converse-Now, is an android application which predicts a captured image containing a Hand Sign to its coresponding Alphabet, and also outputs the coresponding probability of prediction. This app will provide a interface which will bridge the gap between the differently abled and the common mass. Other features are that: users can also "Submit captured Images" to us, with which we can further optimize and improve the neural network model for better accuracy and predictions. The name Converse-Now actually implies to "Let's Communicate freely!" regardless of any barrier restricting them to converse.

<br>
Here, Tap:<br>Capture Image : To capture an image and to predict the alphabet it represents.
<br>Submit Image : To submit an image to us for further improving accuracy of predictions.
<br>
<br>
5. For Submiting data, First press "Choose" button to browse and select an Image. 
<br>

<br>And, the press UPLOAD to upload the image.
<br>A small Toast appears at the bottom after successfull upload of image.
